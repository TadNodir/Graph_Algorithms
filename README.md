# Graph_Algorithms

This is a program, which implements graph data structure and algorithms. The two main graph methods to
find the minimal spanning tree are: Kruskal and Prim algorithms. The method to find the minimal path is Dijkstra
algorithm. Custom classes we created are: Edge, EdgeWeightedGraph, PrimMST, KruskalMST, DirectedEdge,
EdgeWeightedDigraph and DijkstraSP.

The following graph functions are implemented:
• Graph output
• Recursive depth-first search
• Iterative breadth-first search
• Prim (minimum spanning tree)
• Kruskal (minimum spanning tree)
• Finding the sortest path with Dijkstra algorithm
